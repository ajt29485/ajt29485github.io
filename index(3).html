        <p> The Atlanta Hawks are in the midst of rebuilding this year. Growing up, the Hawks were not always my favorite basketball team. They weren't one of the elite 
            teams in the NBA and I didn't really understand the game the way I do now. When I was younger, I watched basketball 
            primarily for the slam dunks and highlights that would happen throughout the course of a game. My favorite player growing up was Kevin Garnett and when
            he was traded to the Boston Celtics they became my favorite team and won the 2008 NBA Finals. Today in 2018, we call that bandwagoning. Also in 2018, 
            I am a bigger fan of the team aspect of the basketball teams than the individual star players that make them most relevant. That is why I've been intently
            following the team building apsect of my hometown basketball team for the last couple years, which has changed drastically in a short period of time. </p>
                <p> The <sup>2014-2015</sup> season for the Atlanta Hawks was a historic season to say the least, setting several franchise records and countless accolades. 
                    They set a franchise record for wins in a season with 60, had four all stars selected to the All-Star Game (Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver, Paul Millsap,
                     and Al Horford) coach of the year (Mike Budenholzer), won 19 straight games including going undefeated in the month of January, and made a trip 
                    to the Eastern Conference Finals as the number 1 seed in the conference. There were other things this team accomplished, but those were the main 
                    highlights. Even with these highlights, the ultimate goal of becoming NBA Champions was not achieved as they lost to LeBron James and the 
                    Cleveland Cavaliers in Conference Finals, who eventually lost to the Golden State Warriors in the Finals. There were several reasons that the 
                    Hawks were not able to become champions this year. There were some key injuries in the series against Cleveland and the team didn't have a true 
                    superstar with all the collected talent they had. There was also the distant realization that this roster had hit its ceiling with this 
                    historic year. </p>

                      Part of the realization that started to unfold in the next couple of seasons was that the second round of the playoffs was about as far as 
                      you were going to get with Paul Millsap and Al Horford as your two best players to go along with a really good but not great point guard in 
                      Jeff Teague. These three were great players who did alot for this team, but they weren't superstars by any means and when you have go against
                      an all time great like LeBron James, there is no chance of winning four times out of seven as long as he is on the floor. The management of
                      the Hawks and the rest of the Eastern Conference knew that this was still LeBron's conference for years to come, and slowly but surely our star
                      players who were aging veterans started to leave in free agency or get traded. This was all lead up to the 2017-2018 season, which will go 
                      down in history as one of the forgotten seasons for the Hawks, but hopefully for good reasoning and results in the future. </p>
                      <p> The <sub>2017-2018</sub> Hawks season has been very long for fans like me. But surprisingly there have been more highlights from this year's team 
                          than the one that got eliminated in the first round last year. I didn't realize that injecting youth throughout this team would enhance
                          my watching experience the way that is has. This year's Hawks team is so much more exciting to watch because you are watching development
                          right before your very eyes rather than watching a relativity old,developed team and knowing their average ceiling. Jeff Teague, Paul 
                          Millsap and Al Horford have now been replaced with Dennis Schroder, Taurean Prince, and John Collins, with the latter three being 24 and 
                          younger. With these young players, we hope that they have a higher ceiling than the really good veterans we had just a couple years ago,
                          and from what I've seen from the young players in terms of their development this season (young, developing players almost always correlates
                          to alot of losing during that time due to inexperience), better days are ahead much sooner rather than much later. </p>
